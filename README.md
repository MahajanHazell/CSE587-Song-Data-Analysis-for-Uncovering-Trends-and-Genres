This repository consists of the Jupyter Notebook for the Data Intensive Computing course project.

About the project: By analyzing the dataset, this project aims to predict the genre and upcoming trends based on various attributes.

# PHASE 1

### File name : [50592568]__[50593888]__[50604221]_phase_1.ipynb

### File structure : 

1. TASK 1. - Forming the problem statement.


2. TASK 2. - Asking Questions.

  Questions asked by Hazel Mahajan (UBID - 50592568)
  Question 1: Is there an optimal song duration that correlates with higher popularity scores? Are shorter or longer songs generally more popular than those with average lengths in the dataset?
  Question 2: Do songs with higher danceability and energy scores have significantly higher popularity compared to songs with lower scores? How do these attributes individually and collectively influence the popularity of a song?

  Questions asked by Shubham Vikas Soni (UBID - 50593888)
  Question 3: Do specific music genres (such as pop, hip-hop, rock, etc.) consistently have higher average popularity scores compared to other genres in the dataset, and does the genre significantly impact a song's popularity?
  Question 4: How do audio features such as danceability, energy, and tempo correlate with the popularity of songs in the dataset? Which of these features has the strongest positive relationship with song popularity?

  Questions asked by Poojan Kaneriya(UBID - 50604221)
  Question 5: Do certain music genres, such as pop or rock, tend to feature songs with higher valence (happiness) scores? Is there a clear relationship between genre and the prevalence of upbeat, happy songs in the dataset?
  Question 6: Is there a negative correlation between acoustics and song popularity? Do songs with higher acoustics scores tend to be less popular than those with lower acoustic scores in the dataset?
  

3. TASK 3. -  Data Retrieval

   
4. TASK 4. - Data Cleaning


5. TASK 5. - Exploratory Data Analysis.

   - EDA fot this hypothesis.
   - Analysis of EDA.
   - Question 2 and its Hypothesis: Songs with higher danceability and energy scores are more popular than songs with lower scores.
   - EDA fot this hypothesis.
   - Analysis of EDA.

   - Question 5 and its Hypothesis: Songs with higher acoustic ness scores are generally less popular.
   - EDA fot this hypothesis.
   - Analysis of EDA.
   - Question 6 and its Hypothesis: Different music genres tend to exhibit distinct characteristics in terms of valence (musical positivity) and danceability.
   - EDA fot this hypothesis.
   - Analysis of EDA.
